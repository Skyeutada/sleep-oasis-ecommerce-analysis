## Project Overview
Analyzed 30 days of live Shopify data (5,065 sessions, 35 orders) for Sleep Oasis, a direct-to-consumer health & wellness brand selling sleep aids (massagers, masks, pillows, etc.).

Applied full-funnel analytics across **Traffic Acquisition**, **Conversion Rates**, **Checkouts**, **Customers**, and **Sales** to identify growth opportunities and deliver prioritized, data-driven recommendations.

**Key Impact**: Recommendations targeted 1.5–2% conversion lift, higher AOV via bundling, and new market entry (Singapore).

## Key Insights & Recommendations
- Mobile drives 53% of traffic → Shift 70–80% ad budget to mobile platforms.
- Weekends generate 2× net sales → Launch weekend flash sales & bundle promotions.
- Hero products convert at 78%+ → Optimize site-wide pages and promote bundles.
- Near-zero retention → Pilot email flows and loyalty tactics.
- Singapore: High traffic, zero sales → Test geo-targeted campaigns.
